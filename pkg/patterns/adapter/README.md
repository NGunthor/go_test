## **Adapter**

The Adapter pattern refers to class-level structural patterns.

Often in a new project, developers want to reuse existing code. For example, existing classes may have the necessary functionality and have incompatible interfaces. In such cases, the Adapter pattern should be used.

The meaning of this pattern is that if you have a class and its interface is not compatible with the code of your system, then to resolve this conflict, we do not change the code of this class, but write an adapter for it. In other words, the Adapter adapts the existing code to the required interface (it is an adapter).
