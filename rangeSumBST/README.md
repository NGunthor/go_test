[<h1>Range Sum of BST</h1><br>](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/)

Given the `root` node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between `L` and `R` (inclusive).<br>

The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

---

<h5>Example 1:</h3><br>

    Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
    Output: 32

<h5>Example 2:</h5><br>

    Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
    Output: 23

<h5>Note:</h5>

<ol>
<li>The number of nodes in the tree is at most <code>10000</code>.</li>
<li>The final answer is guaranteed to be less than <code>2^31</code>.</li>
</ol>
