##**Mediator**

The Mediator pattern refers to object level behavioral patterns.

The Mediator pattern provides an intermediary object that hides the way that many other peer objects interact. Mediator makes the system loosely coupled, eliminating the need for objects to refer to each other, which allows you to change the interaction between them independently.

For example, we have an intermediary between two bank accounts. The intermediary saves one account from interacting the another account directly. The Mediator performs Add and Withdraw operation with the accounts inside of itself
